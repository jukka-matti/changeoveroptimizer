## Section 6: Hidden Benefits (Qualitative)

These benefits are harder to quantify but often significant:

| Benefit | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ⬜ Reduced WIP inventory | High / Medium / Low | Smaller batches = less inventory |
| ⬜ Improved flexibility | High / Medium / Low | Faster response to customers |
| ⬜ Better on-time delivery | High / Medium / Low | Less schedule disruption |
| ⬜ Reduced quality issues | High / Medium / Low | Fewer first-piece problems |
| ⬜ Improved employee morale | High / Medium / Low | Less frustration, clear standards |
| ⬜ Knowledge retention | High / Medium / Low | Documented procedures |

### Inventory Reduction Estimate (Optional)

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Q. Current average batch size | _______ units |
| R. New batch size (with 50% faster changeover) | _______ units |
| S. Batch size reduction | _______ units |
| T. Inventory value per unit | €_______ |
| U. Approximate WIP reduction | €_______ |

## Section 7: Summary

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current annual changeover cost | €____________ |
| Projected annual savings (50% reduction) | €____________ |
| Total investment required | €____________ |
| Payback period | ____________ months |
| First year ROI | ____________ % |
| 3-year net benefit | €____________ |

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis:

⬜ **Strong case:** Payback < 6 months, ROI > 200%
   → Proceed immediately

⬜ **Good case:** Payback 6-12 months, ROI > 100%
   → Proceed with management approval

⬜ **Marginal case:** Payback 12-24 months, ROI 50-100%
   → Consider pilot project first

⬜ **Weak case:** Payback > 24 months, ROI < 50%
   → Look for other opportunities

## Example Calculation

**Scenario:** Packaging line with frequent changeovers

### Inputs
- Changeovers per day: 6
- Average duration: 45 minutes
- Operating days: 250
- Machine cost: €150/hour
- Labor cost: €30/hour
- Operators during changeover: 2

### Current Cost
- Daily changeover time: 6 × 45 = 270 minutes = 4.5 hours
- Daily machine cost: 4.5 × €150 = €675
- Daily labor cost: 4.5 × €30 × 2 = €270
- Daily total: €945
- **Annual cost: €945 × 250 = €236,250**

### With 50% Reduction
- New daily time: 2.25 hours
- New daily cost: €472.50
- **New annual cost: €118,125**
- **Annual savings: €118,125**

### Investment
- Software: €149
- Course: €99
- Quick-release clamps: €2,000
- Shadow boards: €500
- **Total: €2,748**

### ROI
- **Payback: 0.3 months (9 days!)**
- **First year ROI: 4,200%**
- **3-year benefit: €351,627**
