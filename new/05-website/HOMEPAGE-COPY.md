## PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline

## Changeovers Are Killing Your Productivity

### Body Copy

Every manufacturer knows the pain:

**Hours lost to changeovers.** Your production line sits idle while operators fumble through setups. That's money walking out the door.

**Excel chaos.** You've tried to optimize sequences in spreadsheets. It works... sometimes. But with 50 orders and 10 products, who has time to find the best sequence?

**Inconsistent results.** One operator does the changeover in 30 minutes. Another takes 90. No standard, no improvement, no end in sight.

**Sound familiar?**

There's a better way.

## SOLUTION SECTION

### Headline

## Two Tools, One Goal: Less Changeover Time

### Tool 1: Sequence Optimization

**Subheadline:** Find the best production sequence automatically

**Body:**

Import your orders. Define your changeover hierarchy. Click optimize.

ChangeOverOptimizer analyzes thousands of possible sequences and finds the one with minimum changeover time. What takes hours in Excel takes 20 seconds here.

**Results:** 30-50% reduction in total changeover time

**Key Features:**
- Import orders from Excel/CSV
- Visual changeover hierarchy builder
- Respects due date constraints
- Before/after comparison
- Export optimized schedule

### Tool 2: SMED Module

**Subheadline:** Reduce each changeover by 50% or more

**Body:**

Sequence optimization reduces *how many* changeovers you do. SMED reduces *how long* each one takes.

Based on Toyota's proven methodology, our SMED module helps you:
- Analyze every step of your changeover
- Identify what can be done while the machine runs
- Track improvement ideas to completion
- Create standard work for consistent execution
- Time actual changeovers against the standard

**Results:** 50-80% reduction per changeover

**Key Features:**
- Step-by-step changeover analysis
- Internal vs external classification
- Improvement tracking with status workflow
- Standard work generator
- Built-in changeover timer
- Performance analytics over time
